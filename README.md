<h1>📈 Machine Learning Stock Prediction</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
This project explores time-series forecasting for stock prices using machine learning models.  
It demonstrates how historical data can be transformed into predictive insights through:

✅ Data preprocessing and feature engineering  
✅ Model training and evaluation  
✅ Visual forecasting and performance comparison  

The goal is to better understand market behavior, experiment with predictive modeling, and refine ML workflow skills.

<h2>📊 Model Workflow</h2>

1️⃣ Import and clean historical price data  
2️⃣ Create features (windowed sequences, technical indicators, etc.)  
3️⃣ Train predictive models  
4️⃣ Evaluate accuracy with statistical metrics  
5️⃣ Display predictions vs. real performance with charts
